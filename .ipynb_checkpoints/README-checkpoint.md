# Welcome to my code repository for ASTRO 530!

The repository is organized as follows (as of 01/10/2023):

- All functions are imported in the `ASTRO530` directory in the `functions.py` file.
- Each assignment will have its own `.ipynb` notebook, located in the `Assignment Notebooks/` directory. Each notebook will be appropriately named to indicate which assignment is being completed within the file. Each notebook will contain the relevant code to generate plots, do any minor calculations, and markdown components that explain what is being plotted and/or my thought process.
- All plots are saved in the `Plots/` directory, which is then organized by homework, or assignment name (i.e., `HW1/`, `HW2/`).

If you wish to run this code yourself, please ensure that the following packages are installed in your environment:
- `os`
- -`sys`
- `numpy`
- `astropy`
- `matplotlib`
