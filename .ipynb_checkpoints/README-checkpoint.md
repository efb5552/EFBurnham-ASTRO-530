# Welcome to my code repository for ASTRO 530!

The repository is organized as follows:

- All source code for custom functions are located in the `ASTRO530` directory in the `functions.py` file.
- All settings for general plotting with `matplotlib` are located in the `ASTRO530` directory in the `plotting.py` file.
- Each assignment will have its own `.ipynb` notebook, located in the `Assignment Notebooks/` directory. Each notebook will be appropriately named to indicate which assignment is being completed within the file. Each notebook will contain the relevant code to generate plots, perform any minor calculations, and markdown components (if necessary) that explain what is being plotted and/or my thought process.
- All plots are saved in the `Plots/` directory as .png files, which is organized by assignment name (i.e., `HW1/`, `HW2/`).

If you wish to run this code yourself, please ensure that the following packages are installed in your environment:
- `os`
- `sys`
- `numpy`
- `astropy`
- `matplotlib`

Please note that the data structure for this repository is subject to change over the course of the semester. 
If you are confused on where to locate certain parts of assignments, please don't hesitate to add your comments via GitHub, or email me at efb5552@psu.edu.
